## What is the purpose of the Resource Library?

[The Coding Temple Resource Library](https://www.codingtemple.com) is a free,living, easily accessible reference for coding terms and concepts, available to developers at ANY stage of their career,  all over the world. If you forget what JavaScript hoisting is,(like we all do right...) we want you to be able to look up "JS hoisting" on any search engine, click a Coding Temple Resource Library Doc entry, and have an answer in seconds.

## How to contribute to the Resource Library?

In the short term we will utilize Google Drive as a host for the information shared and Sheets for aggregation.

When adding/creating content please follow the follow guidelines for directory structure:

`/*
 * the content/ directory is organized like so:
 *
 * content/
 * |  <child>/
 * |  |  <node>/
 * |  |  |  <node>.md
 * |  |  |  <child>/
 * |  |  |  |  <node>/
 * |  |  |  |  |  <node>.md
 * |  |  |  |  ...
 * |  |  <node>/
 * |  |  |  <node>.md
 * |  <child>/
 * |  |  <node>/
 * |  |  |  <node>.md
 * |  |  ...
 *
 *
 * node: directory containing one .md file with the same name as the node and optionally one child directory
