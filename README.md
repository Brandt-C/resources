## What is the purpose of the Resource Library?

[The Coding Temple Resource Library](https://www.codingtemple.com) is a free,living, easily accessible reference for coding terms and concepts, available to developers at ANY stage of their career,  all over the world. If you forget what JavaScript hoisting is,(like we all do right...) we want you to be able to look up "JS hoisting" on any search engine, click a Coding Temple Resource Library Doc entry, and have an answer in seconds.
