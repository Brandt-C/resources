# Operating Systems

The operating system (OS) is the program that allows the hardware (physical components) of your computer to interact with the software (applications) t hat are installed on it. The three most commonly used operating systems for desktops and laptops are Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Currently, Windows is the most commonly used operating system worldwide;however, much of the globe's programming is actually done on MacOS and Linux as these two OSs are so-called "UNIX" systems. In particular, Linux is commonly used in the IT world and is frequently listed as a desired skill for job postings. Linux is also open-source (free to use), which is obviously a major plus.
